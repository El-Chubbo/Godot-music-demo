 Interactive Music Prototype for Godot

This project is currently built for Godot 4.3 Beta 1. It's a personal prototype to play around with the AudioStreamInteractive feature added with Godot 4.3.
This is not intended to be a template or correct demonstration on how to use the feature.
A more scalable solution will probably be necessary for a full scale project.

There's multiple AudioStreamPlayer nodes, each with a different song associated with it.
The plan is to test different interactive and synchronized audio configurations for each node.
If possible, a menu will be created to choose which song to demo and potentially toggle exact parameters per song.
