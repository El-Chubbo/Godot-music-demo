 Interactive Music Prototype for Godot

This project is currently built for Godot 4.3 Beta 1.

There's multiple AudioStreamPlayer nodes, each with a different song associated with it.
The plan is to test different interactive and synchronized audio configurations for each node.
If possible, a menu will be created to choose which song to demo, and potentially toggle exact parameters per song.
